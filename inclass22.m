%1. Consider the case of the auto-activating gene that we discussed in class
%today. Make a bifurcation diagram for this system by varying the
%activated transcription rate for three cases - in which 1, 4, or 8 copies of the
%transcripton factor are necessary to activate transciption. Comment on your
%results. 

% 2. Make a similar diagram for the case of an autorepressing gene in the
% case that 2 copies are need to turn off the gene.
